    size of the triangle of the "play" icon within the YouTube icon, which is of 11x12 px.
    
    After further reading, the only minimum height that I needed to use was of 20px of height for the YouTube icon. Facebook's
    icon can be of any size, as long as it's as big as the other social media icons. So, I don't have to use a 64x64 size for

    This will be for phone screens, since phone screens could have font sizes that are smaller than 12 px. So, the "Follow
    us" text would have less than 12px of padding below it, so it would be too close to the social media icons, violating
    YouTube's brand guidelines.
    
    However, this will never happen in computer screens, since I'm not planning on using font sizes of less than 12px
    in computer screens, so I don't need the extra padding between "Follow us" and the icons. Besides, if I have
    "padding top" for the social media icons in computer screens, the "Follow us" text would bein a higher position 
    than the site map links, so the text would look disorganized.
