  /* From what I've read from the brand guidelines from both Facebook and YouTube, it seems that both icons need to have 64x64 
  px as their dimensions. Also, the distance between the Youtube icon and anything surrounding it should be of at least the 
  size of the triangle of the "play" icon within the YouTube icon, which is of 11x12 px.

  After further reading, the only minimum height that I needed to use was of 20px of height for the YouTube icon. Facebook's
  icon can be of any size, as long as it's as big as the other social media icons. So, I don't have to use a 64x64 size for 
  both social media icons.

  So, I will add 12 px (the largest dimension of the YouTube triangle) as the padding that should surround the Youtube icon,
  as well as for the FB icon. 

  This will be for phone screens, since phone screens could have font sizes that are smaller than 12 px. So, the "Follow
  us" text would have less than 12px of padding below it, so it would be too close to the social media icons, violating
  YouTube's brand guidelines.

  However, this will never happen in computer screens, since I'm not planning on using font sizes of less than 12px
  in computer screens, so I don't need the extra padding between "Follow us" and the icons. Besides, if I have
  "padding top" for the social media icons in computer screens, the "Follow us" text would bein a higher position 
  than the site map links, so the text would look disorganized.

  I will also specify the size of the icons in here. */
